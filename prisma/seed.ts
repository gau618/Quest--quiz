    { text: "A market for trading commodities like crude oil" },
    { text: "A trading algorithm that seeks out dark patterns in charts" },
  ],
  explanation: "Dark pools are private forums or exchanges for trading securities. Unlike public exchanges where the order book is visible, trades in dark pools are not revealed until after they are executed. This allows large institutional investors to buy or sell large blocks of shares without tipping off the market.",
  learningTip: "A significant portion of all stock trading volume now occurs in dark pools, which has led to debates about market transparency.",

{
  text: "A stock breaks out of a 3-month consolidation range on a Monday morning. However, the trading volume accompanying the breakout is significantly lower than its daily average. What might this indicate?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.MEDIUM,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Technical Analysis")!,
  options: [
    { text: "A very strong and sustainable breakout" },
    { text: "A lack of conviction behind the move, increasing the odds of a 'false breakout'", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "That the breakout is confirmed and traders should buy aggressively" },
    { text: "That the stock's volume indicator is broken" },
  ],
  explanation: "Volume is a critical component of breakout confirmation. A breakout on low volume suggests that there isn't enough institutional participation or broad interest to sustain the move, making it more likely to fail and reverse back into the range.[7]",
  learningTip: "Professional traders often say 'volume precedes price.' Always look for a surge in volume to confirm the validity of a major price move.",
},
{
  text: "What is the primary function of the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) indicator, and which type of trader uses it most frequently?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.HARD,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Technical Analysis")!,
  options: [
    { text: "To predict long-term price targets, used by position traders" },
    { text: "To identify overbought/oversold conditions, used by swing traders" },
    { text: "To provide a benchmark for the average price a stock has traded at throughout the day, weighted by volume; used heavily by institutional traders", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "To smooth out price data like a simple moving average, used by all traders" },
  ],
  explanation: "VWAP is a intraday benchmark representing the true average price. Institutional traders often use it to execute large orders without significantly impacting the market price. A price below VWAP is considered 'cheap' for the day, and a price above is 'expensive'.[7]",
  learningTip: "Many algorithms are programmed to buy below VWAP and sell above it, which is why it can often act as dynamic support or resistance during the trading day.",
},
{
  text: "You notice that a stock appears bullish on a 5-minute chart, but on the daily chart, it is in a clear downtrend and just got rejected at a major resistance level. Which timeframe should carry more weight in your analysis?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.MEDIUM,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Technical Analysis")!,
  options: [
    { text: "The 5-minute chart, because it shows the current momentum" },
    { text: "Both timeframes are equally important" },
    { text: "Neither, you should look at a weekly chart instead" },
    { text: "The daily chart, as longer timeframes reveal the dominant, more powerful trend", isCorrect: true },
  ],
  explanation: "This is a concept of multiple time-frame analysis. The longer-term chart (daily, weekly) establishes the primary trend and key levels. The shorter-term chart (hourly, 5-min) is then used to find precise entry and exit points in the direction of that primary trend.",
  learningTip: "A common trading maxim is 'The trend on the higher timeframe is the path of least resistance.'",
},
{
  text: "A 'bullish engulfing' candlestick pattern occurs when:",
  difficulty: Difficulty.MEDIUM,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Technical Analysis")!,
  options: [
    { text: "A large green candle's body completely engulfs the body of the previous smaller red candle, signaling a potential bullish reversal", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "A large red candle's body completely engulfs the body of the previous smaller green candle" },
    { text: "Two consecutive candles have the same high and low price" },
    { text: "A candle has a very long upper wick and a small body" },
  ],
  explanation: "This two-candle pattern appears in a downtrend and suggests a significant shift in momentum from sellers to buyers. The fact that buyers were able to push the price up and completely erase the previous period's losses is a strong sign of a potential bottom.",
  learningTip: "Like all patterns, a bullish engulfing is more reliable when it forms at a pre-identified support level and is confirmed by high volume.",
},
{
  text: "What does a Point and Figure (P&F) chart uniquely filter out compared to traditional chart types like candlestick or bar charts?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.HARD,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Technical Analysis")!,
  options: [
    { text: "Price" },
    { text: "Time", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "Volume" },
    { text: "Volatility" },
  ],
  explanation: "Point and Figure charts are a unique charting method that only plots significant price movements, regardless of how much time passes between them. A new column of X's (rising prices) or O's (falling prices) is only created when the price reverses by a pre-determined 'box size'.",
  learningTip: "Because they filter out insignificant price 'noise,' P&F charts are excellent for identifying clear support/resistance levels and trendlines.",
},

// === CATEGORY: FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS (8 Questions) ===
{
  text: "A company has a consistently high Return on Equity (ROE) of 25%. However, a DuPont analysis reveals this is driven by very high financial leverage (debt) and thin profit margins. What does this tell you about the quality of the company's performance?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.HARD,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Fundamental Analysis")!,
  options: [
    { text: "The company is a high-quality, safe investment" },
    { text: "The performance is of low quality and is very risky; it is highly dependent on debt to generate returns", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "The DuPont analysis is not relevant in this case" },
    { text: "The company is extremely efficient with its assets" },
  ],
  explanation: "DuPont analysis breaks down ROE into three components: profitability, efficiency, and leverage. A high ROE is only considered 'high quality' if it comes from strong profit margins and efficient asset use, not from taking on excessive debt, which amplifies risk.",
  learningTip: "Always deconstruct financial ratios to understand the story behind the numbers. A single headline number can be very misleading.",
},
{
  text: "An investor is deciding between two retail companies. Company A has a high gross margin but a low net profit margin. Company B has a lower gross margin but a higher net profit margin. What does this likely imply?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.HARD,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Fundamental Analysis")!,
  options: [
    { text: "Company A has better pricing power on its products" },
    { text: "Company B is better at generating revenue" },
    { text: "Company A has a strong brand but is inefficient with its operating expenses (like marketing or rent), while Company B is operationally lean", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "Company B has a higher cost of goods sold" },
  ],
  explanation: "Gross margin reflects the profitability of the core products. Net margin reflects profitability after *all* expenses. The gap between them is due to operating expenses. Company A is profitable at the product level but wastes money on operations, while Company B runs a tighter ship.",
  learningTip: "Analyzing the difference between gross, operating, and net margins can reveal a great deal about a company's business model and operational efficiency.",
},
{
  text: "A company announces it is initiating a 'spin-off' of one of its divisions into a new, independent public company. Why might a company do this, and what is the potential benefit for investors?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.HARD,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Fundamental Analysis")!,
  options: [
    { text: "To hide the division's poor performance" },
    { text: "To reduce the total number of employees" },
    { text: "To raise cash by selling the division to a competitor" },
    { text: "To unlock value by allowing two distinct businesses to focus on their core competencies and be valued independently by the market", isCorrect: true },
  ],
  explanation: "A large conglomerate might find that one of its high-growth tech divisions is being undervalued because it's lumped in with a slow-growth industrial division. A spin-off allows the market to value each business on its own merits, often leading to a higher combined valuation.",
  learningTip: "Spin-offs are a form of corporate restructuring that can create significant investment opportunities for those who do their research.",
},
{
  text: "What is the primary difference between a company's 10-K report and its Proxy Statement (DEF 14A)?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.MEDIUM,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Fundamental Analysis")!,
  options: [
    { text: "The 10-K is an annual report on financial performance and risks; the Proxy Statement is a document used to solicit shareholder votes for an annual meeting", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "The 10-K is filed quarterly, and the Proxy Statement is filed annually" },
    { text: "The 10-K focuses on management's biography, while the Proxy focuses on financial numbers" },
    { text: "There is no significant difference; they contain the same information" },
  ],
  explanation: "The 10-K is a comprehensive overview of the business itself. The Proxy Statement is all about corporate governance: electing directors, approving executive compensation, and voting on shareholder proposals. Both are critical reading for serious investors.",
  learningTip: "The Proxy Statement is the best place to find detailed information about executive pay and potential conflicts of interest on the board of directors.",
},
// === CATEGORY: OPTIONS & DERIVATIVES (9 Questions) ===
{
  text: "An investor believes that XYZ stock, currently at $100, will experience a massive price move in the next month due to an upcoming court ruling, but they have no idea if the news will be good or bad. Which options strategy would be best to profit from this expected high volatility?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.MEDIUM,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Options & Derivatives")!,
  options: [
    { text: "A covered call" },
    { text: "A long straddle (buying a call and a put at the $100 strike)", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "An iron condor" },
    { text: "Selling a cash-secured put" },
  ],
  explanation: "A long straddle is a pure volatility play. It profits if the stock makes a large move in either direction, far enough to cover the cost of buying both the call and the put. It will lose money if the stock stays near the strike price.",
  learningTip: "The main risk of a straddle is 'IV crush'—if the event passes and the stock doesn't move much, the drop in implied volatility will cause the value of both options to plummet.",
},
{
  text: "You sell a cash-secured put on XYZ stock with a strike price of $45 for a premium of $2.00. At expiration, XYZ stock is trading at $42. What is your net cost basis for the stock you are now obligated to buy?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.MEDIUM,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Options & Derivatives")!,
  options: [
    { text: "$45 per share" },
    { text: "$42 per share" },
    { text: "$43 per share", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "$47 per share" },
  ],
  explanation: "You sold the put, so you are obligated to buy the stock at the strike price of $45. However, you received a $2.00 premium for selling the option. This premium reduces your cost basis. Your effective purchase price is the strike price minus the premium: $45 - $2 = $43.",
  learningTip: "Selling cash-secured puts is a popular way to acquire stock at a discount to the price it was trading at when you entered the trade.",
},
{
  text: "A trader wants to get long-term bullish exposure to a high-priced stock like Amazon but doesn't have the capital to buy 100 shares. They could use a stock replacement strategy known as a 'Poor Man's Covered Call,' which involves:",
  difficulty: Difficulty.HARD,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Options & Derivatives")!,
  options: [
    { text: "Selling a far-out-of-the-money put option" },
    { text: "Buying a short-term, at-the-money call option" },
    { text: "Buying a deep-in-the-money LEAPS call and then selling shorter-dated, out-of-the-money calls against it", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "Buying a call and a put option simultaneously" },
  ],
  explanation: "This is a diagonal spread strategy. The long-term LEAPS call (with a high Delta, e.g., >0.80) acts as a substitute for owning the stock, but at a fraction of the cost. The trader then generates income by selling short-term calls against this position, similar to a regular covered call.",
  learningTip: "This strategy offers a high return on capital but requires careful management of the two different option legs.",
},
{
  text: "The VIX Index, often called the 'fear index,' is a measure of what?",
  difficulty: Difficulty.MEDIUM,
  categoryId: categoryMap.get("Options & Derivatives")!,

    { text: "The current level of interest rates" },
    { text: "The market's expectation of 30-day forward-looking volatility, derived from S&P 500 index option prices", isCorrect: true },
  ],
  explanation: "The VIX is not a measure of what *has* happened, but what the options market *expects* to happen. It is calculated using the prices of a wide range of S&P 500 options. A high VIX reading indicates high expected volatility and market fear.",
  learningTip: "The VIX typically has an inverse relationship with the stock market; when the market falls, the VIX rises, and vice versa.",
},

// === CATEGORY: FOREX & COMMODITIES (9 Questions) ===
{
  text: "A trader executes a 'carry trade' by borrowing 10 million Japanese Yen (JPY) at a 0.1% interest rate and converting it to invest in Australian Dollars (AUD), which have a 4.5% interest rate. What is the primary source of profit for this trade, assuming the exchange rate remains stable?",

    { text: "The interest rate differential between the two currencies", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "A favorable move in the AUD/JPY exchange rate" },
    { text: "A decrease in volatility" },
    { text: "The commission paid to the broker" },
  ],
  explanation: "The carry trade is a strategy that seeks to profit from the difference in interest rates between two countries. The trader earns the ~4.4% net interest rate differential. However, this strategy is very risky.",
  learningTip: "The main risk of a carry trade is an adverse currency move. If the AUD weakens significantly against the JPY, it can easily wipe out all the interest rate gains and cause large losses.",
},
{
  text: "You are a trader who buys one standard lot (100,000 units) of EUR/USD at an exchange rate of 1.0750. You later close the position by selling at 1.0820. What is your gross profit in US dollars?",

    { text: "$107,500" },
  ],
  explanation: "The price moved from 1.0750 to 1.0820, which is a gain of 0.0070, or 70 pips. For the EUR/USD pair, the value of one pip on a standard lot is $10. Therefore, the gross profit is 70 pips * $10/pip = $700.",
  learningTip: "Understanding pip value and lot size is fundamental to calculating profit, loss, and risk in Forex trading.",
},
{
  text: "A global manufacturing slowdown is announced, causing concern about future demand for industrial metals. Which of the following commodity futures would you expect to be most negatively impacted by this news?",

    { text: "Copper futures", isCorrect: true },
    { text: "Live cattle futures" },
  ],
  explanation: "Copper is a key industrial metal used in construction, electronics, and manufacturing. Its price is highly sensitive to global economic growth and industrial production. For this reason, it is often nicknamed 'Dr. Copper' for its supposed ability to predict economic health.",
  learningTip: "In contrast, gold is often seen as a 'safe haven' and can rally during times of economic uncertainty.",
},

  options: [
    { text: "Backwardation" },
    { text: "Arbitrage" },
    { text: "Hedging" },
    { text: "Contango", isCorrect: true },
  ],
  explanation: "Contango is the normal state for a futures market. The higher future price reflects the 'cost of carry,' which includes expenses like storage costs, insurance, and the interest foregone on the money tied up in the commodity.",
  learningTip: "The opposite condition, where the futures price is lower than the spot price, is called 'backwardation' and can indicate a current supply shortage.",
},
{
  text: "A commercial airline needs to purchase millions of gallons of jet fuel over the next year. To protect itself from a potential sharp rise in oil prices, the airline's risk management department could do what in the futures market?",

  explanation: "This is a primary use of the futures market: hedging. By buying futures contracts, the airline can lock in a price for its jet fuel needs. If the spot price of oil rises, the loss from paying more for fuel will be offset by the gain on their futures position.",
  learningTip: "This is the role of a 'commercial hedger,' who uses the market to reduce business risk, as opposed to a 'speculator,' who uses it to profit from price changes.",
